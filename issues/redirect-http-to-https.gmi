# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

All http://genenetwork.org URIs should redirect to https://genenetwork.org URIs. This should be done on the HTTP server (nginx) config. Currently, if the user enters the HTTP site on their browser, they stay on the HTTP site.

> Note the issue is that we get errors on an automatic redirect. Needs some work.
