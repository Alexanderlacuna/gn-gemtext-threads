Add spinner or animation to submit form while the user waits.

## Questions

1. Do we want to use xtermjs for binderlite or something simpler/lighter like an 
animation that let's the user know more explicitly that they are waiting for 
a container to be built? A spinning guix gnu logo could be cool.
