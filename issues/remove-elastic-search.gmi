# Remove Elastic Search

Elastic Search is no longer used, yet we have dead code referencing it
in gn2.


## Tasks

* assigned: bonfacekilz
* keywords: chore, elasticsearch
* status: done, completed, closed
* type: bug

## Notes

While at it, "@depracated" was removed since it added extra noise to
the logs.

Seems related to
