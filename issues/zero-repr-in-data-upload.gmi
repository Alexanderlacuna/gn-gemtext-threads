### Introduction

When editing data, given the following data:

```
Strain Name,Value,SE,Count
BXD1,18.8,19.7,x
```

When editing either the "Value", "SE", or "Count" fields to a "0", in
gn2 the value still remains as "x" and isn't updated in the database.

Also, ATM you cannot edit a value to "x", which is similar to removing
a field in the database.
