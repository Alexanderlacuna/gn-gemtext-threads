# Each shepherd service needs its own guix profile.

Currently there are a bunch of shepherd services (on Penguin2, as user shepherd) who are using the global shepherd guix profile and loading guix-bioinformatics at service start time to start their services. This is bad because:

* we aren't using per-service guix-bioinformatics worktrees, so the branch changes between service refreshes
* service start times are high because we have to rebuild the service (due to above)
* services which are restarted are in an "untested" state until they work

## Services which need to be migrated:

* covid19-pubseq (uses shared (broken!) guix profile, uses shared config directory)
* genome_browser (uses own guix profile, uses shared guix-bioinformatics, uses shared config directory)
* hrdp-project (uses shared (broken!) guix profile)
* power (uses shared (broken!) guix profile)
* ratspub (uses own guix profile, uses shared guix-bioinformatics)(deprecated(?))
* rn6app (uses shared (broken!) guix profile)
* singlecell (uses shared (broken!) guix profile)
* pluto (uses own guix profile, uses shared config directory)(currently disabled)

## Services which need to be monitored:

* genenetwork1 (uses own guix profile, uses shared config directory)
* cronjob-pubmed (uses shared guix profile, should use genecup profile)
* mcron (uses shared guix profile, probably OK)
* virtuoso (uses shared guix profile, probably OK)

## Services which already have their own profile:

* bnw
* genecup
* gitea
* cronjob-gitea
* ipfs
