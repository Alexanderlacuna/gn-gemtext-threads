# GN1 Slowness

GN1 needs to clean up the following

```
GNRoot="/gnshare/gn"
find $GNRoot/web/tmp    -mmin +100 -exec rm -rfv {} \;
find $GNRoot/web/image  -mmin +100 -exec rm -rfv {} \;
mkdir -p $GNRoot/web/tmp
mkdir -p $GNRoot/web/image
```

Note that the -delete switch is much faster than -exec, so

```
find $GNRoot/web/image  -mmin +100 -delete
```
