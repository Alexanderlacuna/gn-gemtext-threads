# Using guix-bioinformatics in a channels.scm file

Without this we can't:

* programatically and reproducably use the repository to cherry-pick commits that work with shepherd services

## TODO:

* Adjust the genenetwork2 package to no longer break running `guix pull` with this repository in channels.scm

HOW?

Need to move the function calls to export-graph out of the package definition, compute them ahead of time, and seed their results as native-inputs.
